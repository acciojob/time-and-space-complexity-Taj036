    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to how efficiently an algorithm solves a problem. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity.</p>

    <p>Space Complexity, often denoted as <b>Space Complexity</b>, describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem, typically in terms of the input size O(n). It focuses on how memory requirements grow as the input size increases.</p>
